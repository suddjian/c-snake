Funk-ass snake game that runs in a terminal. About 300 lines of plain C.

I compiled this with clang on Apple Silicon. If you aren't on that your mileage may vary.

```
clang snake.c -o build/snake
```

A couple of times out of every several hundred, the game will fail to place new food for the snake. I haven't been able to figure out why. Enjoy.
